              <h3><a href="#">A Dream Wedding Dress...</a></h3>
              <span id="author">By David Benioff & D. B. Weiss</span>
              <p>
                Whether you've been dreaming of your wedding dress since you
                were five and know the exact specifications you want for it down
                to the last sequin, or you've never thought about it until your
                future spouse's mother nagged, "You still haven't got your
                gown," we've got you covered on how to choose a wedding dress.
                Finding your dream wedding dress can be stressful. After all,
                you've likely never tried one on before, and it's the most
                expensive garment many women will ever own, so it can feel like
                the pressure is definitely on while wedding dress shopping. It
                may also feel like there's a whole new language to decode—tulle,
                A-line, fit-and-flare, organza, sheath, etc.

              <h3><a href="#">Boho Wedding Decor Ideas</a></h3>
              <span id="authors">By Sully Hagedorn-Alvarez</span>
              <p>
                Inspired by nature and the bohemian romantic free spirit,
                boho-chic wedding decor is most brides’ favorite wedding theme.
                Soft and romantic with a poetic vibe and just slightly opulent,
                the bohemian wedding decor staples include earthy tones, natural
                elements, and airy materials inspired by nature and the
                outdoors. When you think bohemian theme think of elements like
                tassels, macrame, dream catchers paired with green leaves,
                wildflowers, pampas grass (what is a boho wedding without it!),
                dried palm leaves, etc., all in an earthy color palette with
                muted hues. Use them to fill beautiful vases, in hanging wedding
                centerpieces, on your wedding arch, literally everywhere, and
                you will surely end up with the whimsical wedding decor of your
                dreams.
